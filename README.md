# Project #6. Radiation Therapy
# Mapping Out Optimal Intensities to Target Cancerous Lesions in the Brain

● Simulated radiotherapy treatment using MATLAB to graphically delineate the malignant region from normal tissue              
● Constructed the objective function by computing the total ionization exposure for healthy cells and the spinal cord            
● Imposed constraints to ensure a lethal dosage of over 7 Rads is delivered by perpendicular beamlets to the tumor
