# Project #3. Automotive Modes:
# Deriving Data-Driven Pathways to Enhance Fuel Efficiency of Hybrid Vehicles

● Processed input data for instantaneous speed and lateral acceleration using MATLAB, obtained from digital sensors                 
● Implemented pseudocode for driving logic, opting for 'economy' mode when vehicle speed is less than 100km/h            
● Configured a connection for control signal to allow 'high performance' mode when acceleration is more than 3m/s^2
